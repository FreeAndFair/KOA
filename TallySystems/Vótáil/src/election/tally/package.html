This package contains Votail, the Irish PR-STV ballot counting system for use 
with either optical ballot scan systems (e.g. Scantegrity) or voter verifiable 
remote online voting systems (e.g. KOA).  The authors would advocate against 
the use ofdirect recording election (DRE) machines, which have been decertified 
in many countries and are no longer used in Ireland.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p> The <code>election.tally</code> package is the top-most package of Votail. 
</p>

<h2>Package Authors</h2>

<p> This package was written by Joseph R. Kiniry and Dermot Cochran with help 
from Patrick E. Tierney.

<h2>Software Engineering Tools Used</h2>

<p> The following software engineering tools were used to develop the Votail 
software. </p>

<ul>
  <li> The <a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">JML tool suite</a>,
      including the JML runtime assertion checking (RAC) compiler
      <em>jmlrac</em>, the
      JML unit test generation tool <em>jmlunit</em>, and the JML
      documentation generation tool <em>jmldoc</em>. <br />

      The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a behavioral interface
      specification language that can be used to specify the behavior
      of Java modules. It combines the design by contract approach of
      Eiffel and the model-based specification approach of the Larch
      family of interface specification languages, with some elements
      of the refinement calculus. <br />

      JML has been used to express the semantics of all core
      classes of the Votail system.
  </li>

  <li> The <a
      href="http://secure.ucd.ie/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</a>
      verification tool <br />

      ESC/Java2 has been used to verify some methods of all data
      structure subcomponents of the Votail Cuntais system.  <em>Verify</em>,
      in this context, means that ESC/Java2 was used to automatically
      prove that the provided implementation fulfills the associated
      contract specified with JML. </p>
  </li>

  <li> The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse development
      environment</a>
  </li>
  
  <li> The <a
      href="http://secure.ucd.ie/products/opensource/BONc/">BONc</a>
      specification tool <br />
  </li>
  
  <li> The <a
      href="http://secure.ucd.ie/products/opensource/Mobius/">Mobius</a>
      program verification environment <br />
  </li>
      
</ul>

<h2>Development Methodology</h2>

<p> The Votail Cuntais system was developed using the following methodology:

<ul>
  <li> The specifications (types and JML annotations) for the classes
      of the core data structures subcomponent were written as
      completely as possible before any code for those classes was
      written.  The specifications were checked, initially and
      continually during development, by running the ESC/Java2
      typechecker and the JML typechecker tools. </li>

  <li> The implementation of the core data structures were written
      according to the previously written specifications.  These
      implementations were checked, using the JML RAC compiler and the
      ESC/Java2 verification tool, continually during development. </li>
      
  <li> Unit tests were generated for all core data structure classes
      of the system using the JML unit test generation tool
      <em>jmlunit</em>.  These test guarantee that every constructor
      and every method of every core class is interactively tested
      against its contract for every interesting data value of the
      system as well for a large set of random input values. <br />

      <!-- (+ 18 33 20 35 48 101) -->
      In a standard test execution, a total of 255 tests were run
      during each test execution cycle.  The test execution cycle has
      been run hundreds of times.  This means that every core class
      has been tested for (tens of) thousands of possible data values.

  <li> The high-level system documentation (like this file) was
      written. </li>
</ul>
