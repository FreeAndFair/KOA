  abstract = 	{ The ESC/Java tool was a lauded advance in effective
               static checking of realistic Java programs, but has
               become out-of-date with respect to Java and the Java
               Modeling Language (JML). The ESC/Java2 project, whose
               progress is described in this paper, builds on the
               final release of ESC/Java from DEC/SRC in several
               ways. It parses all of JML, thus can be used with the
               growing body of JML-annotated Java code; it has
               additional static checking capabilities; and it has
               been designed, constructed, and documented in such a
               way as to improve the toolrsquos usability to both
               users and researchers. It is intended that ESC/Java2 be
               used for further research in, and larger-scale case
               studies of, annotation and verification, and for
               studies in programmer productivity that may result from
               its integration with other tools that work with JML and
               Java. The initial results of the first major use of
               ESC/Java2, that of the verification of parts of the
               tally subsystem of the Dutch Internet voting system are
               presented as well. }
